Veda's Run is a 3D third-person runner with a conversational UI, basic skeletal animation, procedural and manual tiles, loads of effects, a boss "battle", and multiple endings including a secret ending :). 

This was so much fun to build, and it blows me away just what can be done in the browser these days, in 13K no less!

Arrow Keys to Move, Space to Jump 

Chrome is preferred for the higher fidelity effects, Firefox takes a hit on framerates.

Cheat Code: window.gs.doChecks = false in the JavaScript console to explore the game in God mode
